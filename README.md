# Git and GitHub Basics Course Outline

## Description:
Git, undoubtedly the most popular version control system, is an essential skill for any developer, whether you’re working with a team or as an individual. Git’s powerful commands give your project unlimited ‘un-do’s’, let you experiment with alternative branches and allow you to collaborate with others without fear of overriding other’s work.

In addition to learning how to organize and track your project’s history, you’ll also learn how to use GitHub, the largest and most popular code sharing network.



## Prerequisites:
While no programming or development knowledge is required, students shouldn’t be afraid to tackle some code-based examples. Most of Git’s power comes from using terminal commands, so be ready to leave the comfort of your normal user interface.
